### 1.3: What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?
The possibility of loss is also known as risk. Risks are the possible problems that might endanger the objectives of the project stakeholders. It is the possibility of a negative or undesirable outcome. So reduce risks mean help detect and suppress bugs not only in the development stages but also throughout the product life cycle. A risk has some probability between 0% and 100%; it is a possibility, not a certainty. Threrefore,we can not reduce the risk to zero.
