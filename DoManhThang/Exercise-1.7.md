### 1.7: Consider the following three example classes. These are OO faults taken from Joshua Bloch’s Effective Java, Second Edition. Answer the following questions about each.

a) BigDecimal equals require the values to be equal in value and scale, while BigDecimal compareTo only checks that the numbers are equal in value, not a scale.

b) A test case that does not execute the fault.

c) Test cases that execute the fault but don’t result an observable error.
